# HCEA-DebugMenu
Just the Debug Menu Enabled Version of Hale CE Anniversary. I'll likely never bother touching Halo CE extensively with my patching projects.


A debug menu can be brought up by pressing LB + RT to enable debug commands then pressing LB + RB to bring up the debug menu. Not all of the debugging options work, but a majority of them do.
Mission

A simple level select, which enables you to travel to the start of any of the missions.

    -a10 - The Pillar of Autumn
    -a30 - Halo
    -a50 - The Truth and Reconciliation
    -b30 - The Silent Cartographer
    -b40 - Assault on the Control Room
    -c10 - 343 Guilty Spark
    -c20 - The Library
    -c40 - Two Betrayals
    -d20 - Keyes
    -d40 - The Maw

Cheats

These cheats do not work a majority of the time, and you'll just have to play around with them to get them correctly working. Most of these were originally debug functions of Halo: Custom Edition.

    -deathless player (dbgvar) - Enables invincibility (you may take damage, but not die). Alternatively can be toggled by enabling debug commands then pressing **LB + X.**
    -infinite ammo (dbgvar) - Infinite reserve ammunition and grenades. Clips still need reloading. (Similar to the multiplayer option).
    -bottomless clip (dbgvar) - Your gun never uses ammo in your clip. (Again, similar to the multiplayer option).
    -drop weapons (dbgvar) - Drops all currently-equipped weapons.
    -ai is active (dbgvar) - Toggle AI. If disabled, the AI does not do anything and just stands there.
    -kill one shot (dbgvar) - Everything dies in one shot. (NOTE: Custom Edition's equivalent also rendered indestructible vehicles unusable after shooting them. Should look into whether that was kept).
    -medusa (dbgvar) - Enemies die upon becoming aware of the player, but only if they become aware after the cheat's activation.
    -bump possession (dbgvar) - Colliding with an enemy or NPC ally allows the player to take control of it.
    -switch cam mode fly-3rd-fp (dbgvar) - Probably meant to switch the player's camera between first-person, third-person, and free-roaming, but it doesn't work. You can just switch cameras by holding RB when debug commands are enabled.
    -no-clip - Can be toggled by pressing **LB + A** when debug commands are enabled.
    -Screenshot - Pressing **LB + B** saves a screenshot in bmp format to a folder named "shots" in the root of the games directory. Unsure what would happen if game is in GoD or NXE format.

Debug
These options can be toggled without a problem. You can unlock most of the game's unlockables here, except for levels.

    -Unlock skulls (cfgvar) - Unlocks all skulls.
    -Unlock bonus skulls (cfgvar) - Unlocks only the bonus skulls.
    -Unlock KINECT functionality (cfgvar) - Unlocks the Kinect support, although it only works in the Library.
    -Unlock terminals (cfgvar) - Unlocks all terminals.
    -Unlock library - Unlocks every character bio.
    -Play starting video (cfgvar) - Toggle. Disables the long intros in the beginning of the game. Since debug options don't save, this one doesn't work.
    -Respect user saves (lock levels) (cfgvar) - Toggle. Doesn't unlock levels you haven't unlocked normally, and picking missions from the MISSIONS menu doesn't save.
    -Load Main Menu - Brings you back to the Main Menu.
    -Show camera position - Shows your camera location in X, Y, and Z coordinates.
    -Show sounds debug info - Shows the directory and sound file names of the sounds currently being played.
